### Day 67: 07 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - MVP 1

**Thoughts:** Over the weekend, we huddled together, collecting our thoughts. Last week’s stakeholder meeting had dealt us a blow, but we were determined to bounce back. Our first step? Reaching out to the stakeholders. We shared our vision board and survey data, aiming to find common ground.
With renewed focus, we finalized our plans. FAQs and a press release—tools to keep us aligned. And the wireframe? We dissected it, creating a component tree. MVP 1 was within reach.
The journey continues, one step at a time.
