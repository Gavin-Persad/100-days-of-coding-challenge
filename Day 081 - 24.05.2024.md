# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 81: 24 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Day of School of Code

**Thoughts:** Today was the last day at the School of Code. What an amazing experience this has been. I have met some amazing people and learnt and incredible amount. I was very unsure I would make it to today at times and cannot thank the help of the cohort and the coaches enough for making this possible.
I am going to take the weekend to reflect on the experience and being to think about presenting my final project. Then onto a job search, as well as continuing with my side projects.
