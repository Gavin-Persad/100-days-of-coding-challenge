# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 2: 12 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: JavaScript: Types, Variables, Operators, Functions, Conditions and Loops

**Thoughts**: I kinda knew what JS was, but was a little scared to start getting stuck in. So far this has all been very easy to understand. I now need to get playing with the features to see what can be achieved. Working through a simple problem and trying to code a solution in todays task has really shown the importance of looking at a problem and forming an algorithm before thinking about code.
