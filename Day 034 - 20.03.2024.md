# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 34: 20 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Next JS

**Thoughts:** Wednesday is definitely the tough day of the week. Not only is it the longest day, but it also brings the more complex work. Last week, I got a little stressed on Wednesday; however, this week, I didn’t allow the pressure to get to me. This was beneficial as I was able to move past the challenging section of the workshop and complete all other sections, leaving only the one section I will need to revisit after some further investigation. I kept in mind the story from the language professor that we viewed in the first week, his analogy about mowing the lawn. Don’t worry about every blade of grass; what I miss now can be picked up on the next pass. Just keep going.
