**Today's Progress**: Objects and Arrays

**Thoughts:** Today we looked at objects and arrays. These are "directories for variables". Here we save keys and values together as a property pair. In an object there is no order, where as in an array the items are numbered and hold a place in the list. We practised creating objects and arrays and looked as ways we move, use or edit the properties of an array. I also read about shift and unshift to add/remove items from the front of the array, or push and pop to add/remove items from the end of the array. For in loops was also covered, I was following this for use in arrays, however the example for objects left me a little confused. I will look further into this.
