**Today's Progress**: Test Driven Development

**Thoughts:** During our learnings about QA, we have been looking into the ideas of test driven development. This is about creating concrete tests before any functions. So that we can be sure that as we build our function it is being tested along the way. This was a little hard to grasp at first. I think that this was due to having spent the weekend battling away on code wars, and wanting to just tackle the problem. However, we persisted with the idea of TDD and created our tests, which we then used to help structure our function. This felt like a backwards way to be doing something as it was not very time efficient, however once we had compared our function with that of other teams, it was clear to see that we were building in a more "secure" way. Ensure that the function was good to each step of the process. This may not have many benefits whilst working on easy to complete tasks such as we were today, however when working on a much larger scale this would be highly beneficial to ensuring that the function is built well and tested.
