### Day 31: 17 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: CSS and responsive design

**Thoughts:** This weekend I have been refreshing my HTML and CSS skills. I knew entering the course that the design aspects of the course would be somewhere that i felt less comfortable. Yet, I found that the AirBnb clone we made in the course warm up was actually a project that I enjoyed. I must remember the steps that led me to success on that project, which was to take my time, plan well and break the project into small manageable chunks. The scale of a whole project is daunting. Though I just need to be thinking about the next step if I have planned well.
