# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 46: 09 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** Docker and Containers

**Thoughts:**  Docker simplifies app deployment using containers. These containers package everything an app needs: code, libraries, and settings. We create a text file called a dockerfile to hold instructions on how to create the docker image. To create a Docker image, we should follow best practices: start with a good base image, minimize layers, tag images, and avoid using the root user. Containers are like copies of the app, we should aim to keep them small and clear.
