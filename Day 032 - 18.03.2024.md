# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 32: 18 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: CSS, Semantic HTML and responsive design

**Thoughts:** A good brush up on CSS today and practising semantic HTML. We are returning to the front end this week, so catching up with these old skills was good. Remembering the differences between flex and grid to remind ourselves of which one to use and why. It was also important to remember that we can use a combination of them to achieve the goal. Tonight I will begin to read about React. A new language to me, however a good friend, who encouraged me to learn to code and my mentor are both well versed in React, so IÂ  am sure I will be fine. As always, breaking things down into small manageable chunks will be the plan.
