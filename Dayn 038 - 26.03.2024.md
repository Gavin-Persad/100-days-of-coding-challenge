# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 38: 26 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: React (Forms and Handling changes)

**Thoughts:** It was ace to pick up today, where we left off yesterday. The prep work last night was going through the exact steps that caught us in the workshop yesterday.
The workshop today was really to implement these learnings into our on-going project. We found this simple enough and was able to spend time at the end styling the new page. The form usuage can become a little complicated with a larger form. This is another position where careful planning has the upmost importance.
