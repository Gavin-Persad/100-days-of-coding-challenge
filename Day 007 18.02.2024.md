# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 7: 18 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: JS revising, Python, Thinking like a programmer

**Thoughts:** I took a break yesterday. I will aim to the a break once a week where I try not to think too much about the studies. Instead I walked 6 miles to get out and away from my desk. This weekends prep work was minimal. This allowed me to focus my time going over the previous weeks learnings. I have spent most of my time looking over debugging examples and spent some time practising writing JS functions for basic problems. I am happy with my understanding of the methods I have been using in JS. However I am fully aware that this will become more cemented knowledge the more I can give myself time to practise.
