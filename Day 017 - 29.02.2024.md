**Today's Progress**: Problem solving, listening and mindset

**Thoughts:** Today was all about diving deep into the world of problem-solving with Code Wars and the API workshop. In our breakout room we crafted a solid algorithm that was based on the idea of not thinking about code. Just concentrate on how to actually tackle the problem and break that into steps.
Later, we had an insightful session with Joe Trodden, where he emphasized the importance of listening in the feedback process. It really resonated with me, especially when Tom Pauley shared a story about someone in a meeting who could deliver incredibly precise and motivating feedback simply because of their exceptional listening skills. Today was a real eye-opener on the power of attentive listening in our professional growth.
