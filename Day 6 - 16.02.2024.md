# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 6: 16 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: JS project, presentation, Career Advice

**Thoughts:** To wrap up the second week of the School of Code boot camp we finished our weekly hackathon and presented back to the cohort. The challenge pushed us to the extent of our early knowledge and led us onto finding new features of JS by ourselves, to complete the assignment. This feeds back to the ides of looking for help. We took the project as far as we could, then looked for help with the small task we were unsure of. This time we were able to find the advice needed online, but there are many avenues for information we could have explored. I am now feeling like GIT, HTML, CSS and some JS is becoming second nature, it is astonishing how quickly I am progressing as a developer. For two weeks I have been completing a "breath" of NSDR daily. I have found that this has left me with more energy, maybe this has also helped my progress.
