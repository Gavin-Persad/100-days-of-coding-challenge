# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 10: 21 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: APIs, Career Advice

**Thoughts:** Today we had a great talk from Nadeem and Elly. They spoke to us about life in the professional game. This was really good as Elly was a SoC graduate. It was great to pick her brain about what she took from the course and what she didn't that she would have done if she had the opportunity again. We also looked into APIs. This will really push the boudaries of the websites and apps we are building. I will spend some of this evening looking over free APIs to start thinking about how I will make use of these resources.
