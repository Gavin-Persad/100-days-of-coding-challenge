# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 44: 05 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** Research and AB testing

**Thoughts:**  To wrap up our week focusing on UI/UX, we embarked on a research project into A/B testing. This method is a fantastic way to make data-driven decisions and improve our product iteratively. By comparing two versions of a webpage or app feature, we can see which one performs better in terms of user engagement and conversion rates.
