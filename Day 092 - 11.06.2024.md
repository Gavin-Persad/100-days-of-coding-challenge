# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 92: 11 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** SoC Partners

**Thoughts:** Today, I immersed myself in the world of School of Code partnerships. Armed with curiosity and a cup of coffee, I delved into company websites and LinkedIn profiles. Each “About Me” page revealed a unique story—a glimpse into their culture, values, and tech stacks. As I scrolled through their activities, I mentally scored each company based on how well it resonated with my aspirations.

The goal? To find my perfect match—the company where my passion for coding aligns seamlessly with their mission. Tomorrow, armed with my shortlist, I’ll reach out to three top contenders via the hiring partners. It’s a journey of discovery, and I’m excited to see where it leads.
