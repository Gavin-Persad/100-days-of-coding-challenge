# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 45: 08 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** DevOps and Sentry

**Thoughts:**  Today we looked into DevOps and Sentry. DevOps is the combination of development and operations. This is two separate teams that often had conflicting aims. By looking at the two together, we emphasize collaboration and can streamline some processes. We looked into tools that can be used and focused on sentry. This is an automated tool that will look for bugs in our project and create reports of this. We can use these reports to look for patterns like what is causing the most user issues, we can then focus our attention to the more needed issues. The methodology also heavily focuses on small quick releases of updates to be constantly improving the software. This fits with the Agile principles that we have been practising.
