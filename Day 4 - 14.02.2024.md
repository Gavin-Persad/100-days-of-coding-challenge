# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 4: 14 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Debugging and Array Methods

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough one. We started debugging code. For this we looked into DevTools on Chrome and how they could be used to add breakpoints to stop a code during its run, this allowed us to see what variables values were at each point and see where code was stopping. We then practise using console.log to test parts of the code to see what was causing the bugs. 
Following this we began to look into Array Methods. We mainly focused on .map which is mapping over an array. Using this we were able to make changes to all properties in an array without having to code a for loop.
I was asked to code a function in front of the whole cohort today. This was a bit scary, but I was able to complete a working function. This was mainly due to having a break down of the issue infront of me. It is always important to break down the problem and form an algorithm before coding.
