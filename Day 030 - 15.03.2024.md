# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 30: 15 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Code Wars Hackathon

**Thoughts:** This week's hackathon went extremely well. This was due to good planning and a clear vision of how I wanted to tackle the problem. I was able to submit my Kata to CodeWars an hour early and was then able to help my teammates reach the same goal. This was a great end to what had been a troubling week at points. Next week we will return to focusing our attention on the front end again. So I will spend the weekend dusting off my HTML and CSS skills as well as taking a sneak peek into React.
