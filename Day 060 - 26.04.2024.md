# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 60: 26 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** AI

**Thoughts:** As the week draws to a close, our deep dive into AI and its myriad models leaves me both inspired and curious. Jack’s exploration of chatbot creation was particularly captivating, and I’m eager to follow his guide and build my own chatbot over the weekend.
Today marks the end of our structured class sessions at the School of Code. Next week, I embark on my final project—a thrilling challenge that awaits. So, this weekend, I’ll revisit concepts, recap, and gear up for the main event.
