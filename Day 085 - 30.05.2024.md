### Day 85: 30 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Back to presentation prep

**Thoughts:** Today, our team reconvened with a singular mission: perfecting our presentation. Armed with feedback from our coaches, we meticulously tweaked slides, rehearsed transitions, and polished our delivery. The stakes were high—we aimed to impress.
As the recording button blinked, we stepped into the spotlight. Takes flowed—one after another. Each attempt captured our passion, our expertise, and our commitment. But would any of them make the cut? Tomorrow, we’ll gather again, eyes glued to the screen, evaluating our performances. It’s a team effort—a symphony of voices, harmonizing toward success.
