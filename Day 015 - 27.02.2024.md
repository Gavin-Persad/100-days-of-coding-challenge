# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: 27 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Node JS, Express, Importing and Exporting

**Thoughts:** I have found it easy to grasp most concepts so far. Looking into the back end has been extremely complex. In terms of concept, I am on top of it. To fully grasp the subject, I will have to spend a lot of time going through the code and steps. I plan to keep moving forward and frequently review the areas where I am uncertain, with the hope that as I practice in this field, these issues will become clearer. I plan to read new resources on these areas to see if a different viewpoint can be helpful.
