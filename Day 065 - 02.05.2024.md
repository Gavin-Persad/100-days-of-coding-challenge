**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Wireframing

**Thoughts:** In our project journey, we tackled wireframing. We combined our ideas, drew inspiration from successful products, and considered survey feedback. But it wasn’t just about looks; decisions mattered. Joseph Trodden’s “fist of five” technique helped us agree quickly. And voilà—a wireframe we’re all on board with, ready for tomorrow’s stakeholder presentation.
