# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 66: 03 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - 2nd Stakeholder Meeting

**Thoughts:** A bit of a rough one today, but I guess this is all part of the learning curve. We had our 2nd stakeholder meeting. Prepared with wireframes that we have heavily based on our user research we felt confident. The CEO was impressed and liked what she saw, however the lead tech was unimpressed. Stating that we had not focussed in the right areas. We were hit a bit hard by this and confused on how to move forwards.
We regathered as a team and created a plan on how to move forwards. With ideas of putting work to the stakeholder in smaller chunks for more regular feedback and new designs to put out for user feedback, we will spend a bit of extra time over the weekend to catch back up with our goals.
