# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 21: 05 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Databases, SQL

**Thoughts:** Today we began to look into SQL, this came naturally as seemed really easy to use. However I am sure that this can become complex with larger databases. The most important take away from this workshop was again to focus on solving the issue myself and then breaking down the steps I took to complete this.
