# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 35: 21 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Next JS

**Thoughts:** Today I focused on States. This is about creating conditions for a component to react differently when called. We can set a state to true and have it display this text and these styles. Or we can flip it to false and change to that text and those styles.
We also learned about how to use onclick to listen for activity of the user and respond when needed.
I also watched a video on UseEffect, but am yet to play with this.
