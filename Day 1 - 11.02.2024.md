# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 11 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Computational Thinking, GIT and GITHub, AGILE, Disney Ideation, Pair/Mob Programming, Algorithms and AI.

**Thoughts:** This was my "on-boarding" week with the School of Code bootcamp. The main aim of the week was to practise working in the style that we would throughout the course. This was to begin industry practises to cement this in our learnings. Also to begin to think in a computational way whilst obeserving the AGILE principles. We had an inspiring talk from Ira Rainey on mind set. This was the developer for "Dog Tales".
