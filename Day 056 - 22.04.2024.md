# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 56: 22 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Python and AI

**Thoughts:** The last few weeks have been tough. A lot to take on and get my head around.
Plus leading into the employability side of things is worrying, I have never been great at selling myself, so putting something on paper is always tough.
Today, the buzz was back.
Learning python is new and exciting.
I have taken the ideas from the tutorial I created last week and I am trying to create a tutorial for my team mates as I learn.
This is aimed to be clear and concise, so I will need to learn slowly and build good knowledge to be able to create this.
I had lots of fun on UDIO, it took up my entire lunch break, playing with this AI and making some silly songs.
All of these forms of AI are so interesting and fun to play with.
I will definitely take Toms advice and look into how I can use AI to help me break down the more complex issues from the last few weeks.
As well as bounce some ideas of them to see if I can create some good content for my CV and about me sections on GitHub and my portfolio.
