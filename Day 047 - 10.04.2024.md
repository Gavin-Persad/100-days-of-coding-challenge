# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 47: 10 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** AWS

**Thoughts:**  Today we have a great chat with Lizard, an ex-bootercamper who has been working for Santander. He spoke about his job hunt and starting his first role. It was timely to hear this as I am beginning to think about the end of the bootcamp and what steps I would then like to take. We then focussed our attention on AWS Quest. This game is an interactive way to learn about the services available on AWS. We focussed mainly on EC2, S3, RDS, VPC and Cloudfront. This made using the services feel simple. I am sure it will take some practise to be fully aware of all of the functions and options.
