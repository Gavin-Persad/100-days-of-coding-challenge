# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: 26 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Back End, Node JS, problem solving with Code Wars, linting and formatting

**Thoughts:** Today was a whirlwind of information. The day started with a session of code wars designed to improve problem solving and algorithm formation. This session was valuable because I had already told my new teammates that I wanted to focus on improving pseudocode and clean code this week. We then discussed how linting and formatting tools will help with this. After some reading on the subject, I installed ESLint and Prettier, I have not yet had the chance to try these tools, but will begin to try them over the coming workshops. The session ended with a flash over how back end operations work, and how we can use Node.JS to create these back end servers. I learned a lot of information in a short session, yet to fully comprehend back end operations, I will need to spend considerable time reviewing this area.
