# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 40: 28 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** School of Code halfway point

**Thoughts:** I have made it to the halfway point of the school of code bootcamp. It has been such a ride. 8 weeks ago I had no knowledge of programming at all. I had spent some time on HTML and CSS during the precourse but that was all. I am now happy to say I am comfortable with working with new people, planning and disney ideation, AGILE, forming algorythms, JS (I have developed a small code wars addiction), SQL, React JS (getting there), Next JS, Node JS, TDD, HTTP methods, APIs and most importantly learning to learn.
I am going to take the weekend to look back at everything I have learned over the two months and see how well I have embedded this information. From this I will plan how I should focus my learning for the coming weeks.
