# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 5: 15 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: JS practise, computational thinking, planning

**Thoughts:** A great talk from Joseph Trodden on mindset today. This has led me to thinking how I have reacted to feedback in the past, and how I can improve to make the most of feedback moving forwards.
As a team, we also began working on a rock paper scissors game today. We agreed as a team, that the more time we could put towards breaking down the issues and planning would lead to quicker and easier coding. This worked well and we were able to publish our first MVP.
During this I noticed that as I was trying to computationally think my way through the issue, I was using words such as array and function.
Tonight I will play with the Odin Project and FCC to cover topics that I should now be comfortable with. This is to test my learnings and help cement the knowledge.
