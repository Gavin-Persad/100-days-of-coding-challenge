# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 26: 11 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Unit Testing and Vitest

**Thoughts:** Today we began learning about Quality Assurance and how this is practised in modern tech. We began looking to see how we could build, test files that would use Vitest to check our functions to ensure we are getting the correct results. To do this we must think about the three A's. Arrange, to sort our variables of the input and expected output. Act, to use the function to see what result it produces. Assert, to compare the actual result with the expected result to ensure the function is working.
