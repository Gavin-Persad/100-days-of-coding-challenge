# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 48: 11 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** Employment

**Thoughts:**  Today we had a great chat with the team who we will work with once completing the bootcamp to find ourselves a first role in tech. This was an extremely insightful chat. It is great to see the level of support that will be there for us. It has been a little daunting to think that we will be on our own in only a few weeks. The team broke down how they will help with CV's and interview prep, yet they clearly stated that self admin and working on projects will be the best lead. Also to engage with them as much as possible once the bootcamp has ended. This is great advice and things I should begin to plan for.
