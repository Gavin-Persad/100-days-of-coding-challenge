# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 22: 06 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Hackathon, Mind set, Code wars

**Thoughts:** Today I recalled that a map function can we used to map over the contents of an array and make changes to each property.

This came up during a code wars game. It reminded me that practising little puzzles like this will keep me in tune with the different methods I have to use within JS.

We also began to plan our hackathon today. The planning process went very well and we were able to complete a visual database schema. I am confident that this will be a success based on planning with realistic expectation.
