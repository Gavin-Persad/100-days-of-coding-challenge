# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 90: 07 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** First day of life post School of Code

**Thoughts:** Today, I dipped my toes into the job market—applications sent, fingers crossed. But what really excites me? The upcoming employability sessions next week. I’m hungry for insights, tips, and that golden nugget of advice that could make all the difference.
Meanwhile, my side project—the game logic—is proving trickier than expected. So, I’m turning to draw.io, mapping out a flow diagram. It’s like plotting coordinates before setting sail. For now, no coding until my algorithym is planned.
