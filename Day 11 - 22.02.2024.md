# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: 22 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: APIs, JSON and POSTMAN

**Thoughts:** Today we began to plan a weather app for this weeks Hackathon. This will be a real challenge as we will be expected to use our HTML CSS AND JS knowledge together to complete the challenge. We have spent some time playing with the postman app to understand how we will receive the information that we have requested. From looking into this we have been able to plan how to extract this information and make use of it. This was important to do before we planned our algorithm as we were to make plans for this. Had we have made the plans already they may not have fit with the structure in which we were being provided the information.
