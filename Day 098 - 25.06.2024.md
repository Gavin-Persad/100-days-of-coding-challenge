# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 98: 25 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Top Trumps MVP Deployed!

**Thoughts:** 🎮 I’ve been heads-down working on my Top Trumps project, and I’m thrilled to share that the first MVP is now live, thanks to Vercel! 🌟

🔍 Next steps? I’m diving into DevOps improvements, exploring testing strategies, and pondering whether AWS deployment would boost my CV. Once the infrastructure is solid, I’ll polish the UI with CSS magic and expand the game content—more cards, more fun! 🃏
