# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 62: 29 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project

**Thoughts:** As we enter the closing stages of the course, we begin our final project. Today was a soft introduction to the month ahead. We were introduced to a team of 6, this will be our team throughout the month. We had a short icebreaker before planning how we would work as a unit.
In the afternoon we were given a brief and informed of an appointment with the stakeholder tomorrow, so we arranged an introductory presentation for the meet.
Once we had received the brief, everyone was very excited and keen to start pumping out ideas. I used this opportunity to practise the teachings of Joseph Trodden, and focus on listening. Once the room had settled, I was able to summarise the ideas that I had heard and was noting down.
