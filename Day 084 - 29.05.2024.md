# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 84: 29 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** A day off, spent well.

**Thoughts:** As our team eagerly awaits feedback on our final presentation, we’ve taken a day to focus on other areas. While some dove into CVs and portfolios, I returned to my passion project—the top trumps game.
Progress is steady. With a roster of players meticulously set up in my data, I’m ready to build the game. But here’s the exciting part: flexibility. Once the game’s foundation is laid, I can effortlessly create variations—race cars, rivers of the world, you name it—by tweaking the data passed to the props.
For now, football rules the pitch. But watch out—I’m eyeing those params to filter players. English-only? Strikers only? The possibilities are endless.
