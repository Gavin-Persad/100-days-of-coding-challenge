**Today's Progress**: DOM Manipulation

**Thoughts:** DOM Manipulation is where things become complex. So far everything has worked like a block diagram, one thing at a time. Now we are looking into having lots of things making live changes to provide an interactive experience for the user. This seems extremely complex, however, I will take it one step at a time as we have been taught so far. Today I was able to select elements of a HTML document using a JS Script and then add, delete or edit these elements and add CSS styles.
