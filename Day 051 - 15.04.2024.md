# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 51: 15 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Portfolio and Cyber Security

**Thoughts:** Portfolio planning has been on my mind all weekend. I made some plans yesterday using figma this was able to help me work out a brief visual plan for my website, which I put to some peers for early feedback. The page as planned is not too overwhelming. I will keep to the agile principles that I have learnt and work in a CI/CD method to be constantly adding improvements to the page.
Today's learnings focussed on cyber security, which will be our studies for the week. We began by looking into AppSec with a fantastic talk from Ira Rainey. DevSecOps seems to be the general curve of things to come, so it is important that I take on these principles as I move forwards.
