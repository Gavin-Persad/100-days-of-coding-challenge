# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 54: 18 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Husky and TypeScript

**Thoughts:** Today I learnt about husky, and how we can use husky to manage git hooks. This is where we can create files that will execute at certain points.
For example, on my deployed portfolio page, I have a workflow to re-deploy the page on any commit to the main branch.
Using hooks, I have set it up to block this until the repository has used a linting tool and if this has any errors cancel the deployment and report these errors.
This was a little complex to set up and I will need to look back through to fully understand what is happening at each step.
A really useful tool. I would like to look into arranging lots of automated tools like this at the start of a big project with the aim of being efficient whilst working.
This will work alongside the DevSecOps principles that I am looking to apply to my career.
