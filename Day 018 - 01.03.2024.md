# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: 01 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: API Hackaton

**Thoughts:** The world of back end felt like a real step up this week. However by the end of the week I was unsure of why I had struggled earlier in the week. The new express concepts that we were using were not the most complicated part of the workshops. The biggest problems were just that, the problems. Through thinking things through and breaking down the issues, I have been able to work my way through most of the challenges. The Hacakthon could have been a little better this week, however this was due to me wanting to do more than I had time for. This was not an issue for our presentation, as we have our first MVP working we were able to show this. I am happy that we practised the race car and hiker theory during the hackathon. We may have not been able to complete as many functions as we would have liked, however by working through the issues with my team mates left me with a deeper understanding on the problems and the steps I was taking to solve them.
