# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 91: 10 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Preparing for a job search

**Thoughts:** Today, I delved into the partners of the School of Code, seeking the perfect fit. With fellow boot campers, I dissected their values, missions, and tech stacks. Soon, I’ll tailor my CV and shoot it over to them.
Time slipped away today—no coding, no side projects. But tomorrow, I’ll dive back in. Because every step fuels my journey toward becoming the developer I aspire to be.
