# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 57: 23 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Python and AI

**Thoughts:** Today we continued as a cohort to look into AI, we actually started to look into how to create AI, on an abstract level. Though by using these simple models in JS, we were able to understand how a program can run to evolve its learning. In my own studying time I continued to look into Python. I have begun to find some differences between python and JS. This is great to see the need to learn new tech as it may be helpful in ways that my current stack cannot manage.
