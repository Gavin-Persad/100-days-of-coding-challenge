# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 93: 12 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Cover letter, jobs board and partners.

**Thoughts:** I’ve been sharpening my tools for the job hunt. First, I crafted a practice cover letter—a scaffold I’ll adapt for each application. Next, I signed up for Otta, my radar for tech opportunities. And speaking of matches, I’ve narrowed down my top three School of Code partners. Soon, my CV will be on its way to them. Let’s see where this journey leads.
