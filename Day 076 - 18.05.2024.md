# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 75: 17 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** A day off from the project

**Thoughts:** Lately, our project hasn’t flexed my coding muscles enough. So, I dusted off an old gem—a football players’ Top Trumps game. Remember those? The thrill of stats, the suspense of the draw. Nostalgia nudged me, and I dove in.
But here’s the twist: APIs. My trusty data source turned fickle. Hiccups, glitches—the works. The data I craved remained elusive. So, I pivot. New sources, fresh challenges. Because in this code dance, adaptability wins. And who knows? Maybe my Top Trumps will trump all.
