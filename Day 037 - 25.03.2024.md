**Today's Progress**: React (States and Props)

**Thoughts:** Today marked a gentle start to the week, which was perfect as I had taken a break over the weekend. We revisited last week’s learning on React, focusing on how to utilize state and props to modify the information and styles on a website. This served as an excellent refresher on the methods available in React, and we swiftly completed the task, resulting in a visually appealing page. Next, we tackled the stretch goals, which included creating an ‘add card’ function. This required us to use forms to gather information—a topic we haven’t explored yet. We started researching this on our own, but due to time constraints, we didn’t make significant progress. Fortunately, this will be the main focus of tomorrow’s work, and with tonight’s pre-reading, I’m confident I’ll gain a deeper understanding of the subject.
