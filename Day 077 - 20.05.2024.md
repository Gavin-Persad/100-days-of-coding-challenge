# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 75: 17 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Final Week

**Thoughts:** As we entered the last week of our project, our team made a deliberate choice: quality over quantity. Instead of chasing new features, we focused on refining what we had. Our goal? A polished product that would leave users impressed.
We reviewed code, fixed bugs, and fine-tuned every detail. The finish line wasnâ€™t about bells and whistles; it was about a seamless user experience. And if time allowed, those additional ideas would find their place. But for now, excellence was our compass.
