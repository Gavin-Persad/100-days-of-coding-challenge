# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 58 + 59: 25 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** AWS Summit and CV

**Thoughts:** The AWS London Summit was a great day out and a real insight to the industry. Meeting fellow bootcampers face-to-face was a highlight—finally connecting beyond screens.
The industry buzzwords—AI, DevSecOps, and automation—echoed throughout the day. Vendors showcased their AI models, each striving for uniqueness. DevSecOps emerged as the new normal, bridging security and development seamlessly.
Today, I focused on crafting my CV. The employment team awaits, ready to guide us toward exciting job prospects. As we navigate this maze of possibilities, I’m grateful for the solid foundation our bootcamp provided.
