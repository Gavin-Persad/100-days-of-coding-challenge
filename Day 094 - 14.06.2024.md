**Today's Progress:** Technical Interviews

**Thoughts:** Today marked my debut in the world of technical interviews. I’ll admit—I was nervous. But you know what? It wasn’t as daunting as I expected. Sure, I didn’t score 100%, but that’s okay. There’s room for improvement, and I’m up for the challenge.
From now on, I’ll keep sharpening my skills with coding challenges. After all, practice makes progress. Here’s to growth and staying in check!
