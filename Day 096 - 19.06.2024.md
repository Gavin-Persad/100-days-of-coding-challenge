**Today's Progress:** Getting the balance right

**Thoughts:** Over the past week, my focus has been laser-sharp on job hunting. I’ve meticulously tailored my CVs, scoured job boards, and submitted applications. But in the process, I realized I’d neglected my personal growth—those side projects that fuel my passion for learning.
Today, I struck a balance. The morning was dedicated to job applications, and I felt the thrill of potential opportunities. But the afternoon? Ah, that was reserved for my pet project: “Top Trumps.” As I dove back into coding, I rediscovered the joy of problem-solving. Each line of code felt like a step toward expanding my knowledge.
So here’s to equilibrium—the delicate dance between job search and creativity. Because sometimes, it’s in building projects that we truly find our stride.
