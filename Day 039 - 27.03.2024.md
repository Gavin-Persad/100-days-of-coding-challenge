# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 39: 27 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: React (Forms APIs)

**Thoughts:** Today we brought another API into our project. This was simple as we have done it before. The issues we found were about how to collect the required data from the json we received and how to use this.
The patterns we went through to solve this problem was similar to the ones we have been doing for weeks. None of it was new, it was all basic JS.
This is another reminder to keep practising breaking downs these problems, as we will face lots of them through a career in coding.
