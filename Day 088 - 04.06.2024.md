**Today's Progress:** Dress rehearsals for Demo Day

**Thoughts:** Today buzzed with anticipation—the final dress rehearsals for our upcoming demo day. As a team, we stepped onto the virtual stage, each slide a stepping stone toward our grand reveal. But this wasn’t about costumes or spotlights; it was about ironing out kinks.
Feedback from the last rehearsals guided our tweaks. A word here, a smoother transition there. We fine-tuned, knowing that these moments mattered. Tomorrow, we’ll stand before our digital audience, hearts racing, fingers poised. The curtain rises, and we’ll deliver—a culmination of code, creativity, and camaraderie.
