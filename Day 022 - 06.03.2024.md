# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 22: 06 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Databases, SQL

**Thoughts:** Today we advanced our knowledge of SQL with a fun murder mystery game. This was simple and we were able to fly through this onto a challenge that introduces the self join function that allowed us to join two tables together. So far I have been finding SQL rather simple to understand and use. In the afternoon we began a task where we would have to connect an api to a database. For this we used render to host our database and postman to fetch information to ensure we had our API working. We were very confused when we were unable to get the postman to reply information from the database. This led to us gaining a better understanding of the operations here. The database and the postman are not communicating as we need the API to pass the information. This has led to a much greater understanding of how this is all working.
