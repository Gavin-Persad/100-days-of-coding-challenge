# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 53: 17 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** TS and React

**Thoughts:** TS is hard.
Even more so when I make it hard for myself.
Break down the problem, into separate functions if needed.
Keep it simple and use console log to check each section before moving on.
Today we started with planning in this way and somewhere through we were convinced to try build everything in one function.
When this stopped working we were then looking at a big mess.
Take your time, break things down.
This is a lot easier to say that keep to. We need to keep to it.
