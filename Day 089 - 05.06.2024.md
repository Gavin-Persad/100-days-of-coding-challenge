# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 89: 05 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Demo Day

**Thoughts:** Today was Demo Day, and we ran our presentation five times for different employers. It went really well, and we aced the Q&A sessions in each round. Plus, it was great to spot a familiar face in the audienceâ€”a reassuring nod of support.
