# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 36: 22 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Hackathon

**Thoughts:** This week was a real ride. It is so rewarding that starting Tuesday I had never touched React and starting Wednesday I had never touched Next JS. Yet today I was able to present working website, with mutiple pages over seperate routes, drop down menus and cards that can be changed based on information pulled from an API. The project was a real success and I can only put this down to my team mate being of a highly competent level. Thanks again Igor.
