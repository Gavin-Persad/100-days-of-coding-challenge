# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 71: 13 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - API => API => API

**Thoughts:** Our recent project led us down the winding path of API calls, specifically aimed at gathering information about local recycling shops and donation centers. Simple, right? Not quite.
First, we dialed an API for longitude and latitude coordinates—a digital compass to guide us. Then, another call—this time for the actual shops. But life is full of surprises. Our data payload arrived, and it wasn’t just shop names and addresses—it was a treasure trove. Phone numbers, opening hours, and user ratings spilled forth.
Adaptability kicked in. Plans shifted. Suddenly, our canvas expanded. We embraced the unexpected bounty, weaving it into our project tapestry. Because sometimes, the best discoveries lie beyond the blueprint.
In this dance of data, we learned: APIs aren’t just endpoints; they’re gateways to uncharted realms. And as we code, we remain open—to twists, turns, and the magic of unintended extras.
