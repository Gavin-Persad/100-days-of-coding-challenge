# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: 03 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Node JS

**Thoughts:** I was a little unhappy with my progress last week, as I was still unsure of some back end operations. Due to this I spent the weekend working on a new API. The aim of this was to ensure that I was able to complete a new API by myself and most importantly comment as to what each line of code does. This was excellent as the process has left me with a much deeper understanding for what I was doing. I also began to look into how to set up databases, as this is the work for next week.
