# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 9: 20 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Event Listeners

**Thoughts:** Continuing my learning of how I can manipulate the DOM, I learnt about Event Listeners. This is the step I have been looking forwards to. With event listeners we can now begin to think about how a user will interact with our webpage. Doing the challenges today showed why we have been taught in such a structure, as to complete the task we have had to look back to our earlier lessons. At each stage of the learning structure it has been evident, that the most important lesson was the first. Break down the problem and form and algorithm before coding. "code is us telling the computer how the algorithm works".
