# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: 28 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Planning, Express, Planning

**Thoughts:** Nadeem Shabir gave an intriguing talk today, which was accompanied by Alex Cooper. This was a deep dive into the world of APIs and more specifically REST APIs. It is great to have talks like this from industry leaders as a lot of what Chris says is echoed by them. This brings about confidence in the syllabus we are being taught. This week I have really wanted to focus more on planning and pseudocode. I mentioned this to my new team earlier in the week, but let it slip a little yesterday. For today's workshop, we made a point of fully planing. The first ticket was simple, but the planning made it really simple. We were able to complete this with ease. The second ticket was using a method on Express that I have never used before, never seen coded and I was stumped at what to do. So as I would for any problem, I made a plan. This plan was very basic as I was literally writing down the steps I would take to complete the task manually. However, when I reviewed these steps, I knew how to complete most of the steps. There was just one, using this new method, that I would look to see how this was coded. This was a great moment as it felt like things are really starting to click.
