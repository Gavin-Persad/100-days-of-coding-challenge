### Day 95: 17 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** A Day of Learning and Networking

**Thoughts:** This morning’s employability session kicked off with insights from Mike Elsmore. Hearing about the evolution of his career was enlightening—a reminder that growth is a constant journey.
Though today’s schedule is brief, it’s packed with value. I’m looking forward to connecting with a peer from my cohort and later, an inspiring figure in the industry. It’s these interactions that fuel my passion and drive in tech.
