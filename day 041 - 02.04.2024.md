# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 40: 28 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** A long break and reflection

**Thoughts:** Over the long weekend, I took a break from School of Code work and focussed on my on-going side project. This project has seen a few phases, as we keep restarting the project with every new tool we learnt about. After some late learning with Next JS, we were able to start the project with React. This will be our launch product and we have been carefully planning the new feature as well as getting the old code working within React. Through working on this project I have been able to practise most areas that I have learnt over the 8 weeks of school of code. Most important in this is planning and working as a team. The only areas that are not yet within this project are back end and working with DBs, also we have yet to make use of useReduce from React. However there are future plans to get to these, they are just a few MVPs down the line.
