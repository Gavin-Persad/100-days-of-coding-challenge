# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 64: 01 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Research and Surveying

**Thoughts:** Today, I had the privilege of attending enlightening talks—one by ex-bootcamper Maria Crawford. She spoke about the next steps of the School of Code journey. This was excellent to hear as she was very open and spoke about the highs and lows yet to come. The talk was also based with the learnings that she had taken from the course to her new role.
Another captivating session featured Gosia Szewczuk and Jane Fallon from Method. Their mission? User-focused products to enhance government digital services. Witnessing their passion and the impact of their work was truly inspiring.
As our project unfolded, we split into smaller teams. My role? Crafting a project timeline plan. GitHub Projects became our compass, steering us toward goals and deadlines. And then, a survey—a window into our potential users’ needs. Not just their wants, mind you. We’re on a quest to uncover what truly matters.
