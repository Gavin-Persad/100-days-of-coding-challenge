**Today's Progress**: APIs, Async Await and Query Selectors

**Thoughts:** Today we completed a browser weather app and presented this back to the cohort. This was a difficult task as we would need to use async and await in our functions to ensure we had recieved information from the API that we were looking to display before the program continued. After watching a few videos on the subject I felt that I had understood the concept and was ready to code. This turned out to be incorrect, as I encountered lots of issues implementing the async await. Even though I understood what needed to be done, I didn't fully grasp the concept until I playing about with it. This goes back to what Chris has said about it being easier for us to learn with practise rather than just by reading.
