# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 33: 19 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: REACT

**Thoughts:** This week marked an exciting transition to learning React. With both my mentor and a dear friend excelling in this domain, my eagerness to grasp the nuances of their projects has been mounting. Admittedly, the prospect of scaling projects to new heights with React’s dynamic capabilities did stir some nerves. Yet, the initiation into React’s world has been gentle and lucid, making the learning curve manageable. The inaugural workshop unfolded smoothly, leaving me content with the progress made.
