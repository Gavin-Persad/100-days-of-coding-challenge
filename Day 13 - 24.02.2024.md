# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: 24 February, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Reflection and HTML practise

**Thoughts:** This weekend I took time to reflect on the boot camp so far. It has been a real ride and I have learnt an incredible amount. More than I would have believed. However as I have learnt as such a pace. I thought it would be good to go back through the earlier sections of the course to ensure they are fresh in mind and being practised as much as the newer materials. I also found that my latest presentation was not great. This is something I have always been naturally good at, so it was disappointing to under perform here. I will also put time aside to make sure I am working and improving on these skills as they will be important for my career.
