### Day 70: 10 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Stakeholder Meeting 3

**Thoughts:** As the week winds down, our team gears up for a crucial stakeholder meeting. Last time? Well, let’s just say it didn’t dazzle. But this week, we’re on a mission—to impress, to shine.
Morning surprise: the stakeholder emails. Meeting pushed from 10 am to 2 pm. Our MVP 1? Still a work in progress. So, we seize the extra hours, buffing it to perfection.
In our huddle, ideas bubble—new features, fixes. But we hold back. Feedback first. Agility rules.
Tomorrow, we face the canvas—a blend of promise and potential. Ready or not, here we come.
