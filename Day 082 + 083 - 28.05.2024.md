### Day 82 + 82: 28 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Project Presentation and Side Projects

**Thoughts:** Yesterday, my side project took center stage. Inspired by the world of football, I set out to create a top trumps game. The plan? Tap into an EAFC API for player data. But alas, technical hiccups intervened. Undeterred, I decided to forge my own path. Starting with a select group of players, I dove into crafting the app. And who knows? Maybe a database upgrade awaits down the line.
Today, the project team huddled virtually. Our mission? Craft a compelling presentation for demo day. It’s our chance to shine, to showcase our brainchild to potential employers. The code, the vision—it all converges. So, here’s to navigating these waters, one line of code and one slide at a time.
