# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 25: 10 March, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Code Wars

**Thoughts:** I spent a good few hours on Code Wars over the weekend. This was with the aim of having my honour points up to 300 to receive a special challenge today. This was a lot of work and tough to manage around my other commitments, however I was able to complete the tasks and reach my goal. The most important lesson taken from this activity was breaking things down to a plan. This made most of the challenge very simple. The few areas where I was unsure a quick google was able to put me back on track.
