# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 55: 19 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** TypeScript Hackathon

**Thoughts:** We ended the week by creating a tutorial to cover the basics of TypeScript. This was excellent, as coming into the hackathon I was not confident in the subject at all. By looking to create a tutorial, I first needed to go back to workshops and tutorials and get a really good base knowledge of what I wanted to explain.
This was a great way to learn about the subject and I can feel much more confident here.
