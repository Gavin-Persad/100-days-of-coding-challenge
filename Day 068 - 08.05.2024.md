# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 68: 08 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Scaffolding and Guest Speakers

**Thoughts:** Our final project split our team into two: data organizers and code scaffold builders. While some arranged stakeholder data, I focused on transforming the component tree into a robust base code. Guest speakers Jadene Aderonmu and Bethan Philimore emphasized accessibility, and Nadeem candidly discussed imposter syndrome. These insights shape our journey as we build both code and community.
