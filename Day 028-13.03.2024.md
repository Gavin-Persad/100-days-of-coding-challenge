# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: API and End to End Testing

**Thoughts:** Today started with a talk from the team of Technology from Sage, thanks Nadeem and Darren. Again this was based very closely to our current learning about testing. This was a useful insight into how TDD was used in a professional setting. This has shown a real importance to focus on testing as I build my projects moving forwards. The afternoon session was about how end to end testing can become a lot quicker when using PlayWright, however we were able to see the code on how this can be done manually as well.
