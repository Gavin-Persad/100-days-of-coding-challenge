# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 69: 09 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Styling

**Thoughts:** Today was all about jazzing up our project. We rolled up our sleeves, tinkering with styles to give our components that pro look. But guess what? Time played the villain—some tasks remained unfinished. So, we shifted gears, focusing on the juicy bits we’ll flaunt during tomorrow’s stakeholder showdown. We’ve got a battle plan ready, slides prepped, and nerves tingling. Tomorrow’s meeting? It’s like a rollercoaster ride—we’re strapped in, ready for the twists and turns.
