# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 52: 16 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Supabase and React Fundamentals

**Thoughts:** Today we used Supabase to make a log in page for a website. This was worrying at first, I had tried to contemplate how I would go about this task alone and the needed steps seemed to be quite an amount of work. However, with tools like supabase we can cut a large amount of the work and also feel a bit more secure knowing that the team there are constantly looking for ways to improve security.
After this I took a quick catch up with the fundamentals of React. This wasn't too heavy on code as I was expecting. Instead, we took an abstract view of how the components, props and state all interact.
