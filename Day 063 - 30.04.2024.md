# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 63: 30 April, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - 1st Stakeholder Meeting

**Thoughts:** Today, we gathered with the stakeholder, accompanied by the CEO and her tech assistant. Their vision unfolded—a roadmap of desires. But this wasn’t a monologue; questions flowed freely. Armed with insights, we began dissecting the problem, crafting user personas. And in the spirit of DevSecOps, we explored deployment strategies.
As our project unfolds, we’ll harness the power of Vercel to deploy our creation into the digital realm.
