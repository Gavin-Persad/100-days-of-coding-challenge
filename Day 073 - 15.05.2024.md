### Day 73: 15 May, 2024

**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Presentation

**Thoughts:** Today, we tackled yesterday’s issues head-on. Our goal? To prepare the product for today’s presentation. The team worked diligently, ironing out glitches and ensuring everything was in order. Success! The product now stands ready.
Tomorrow, we shift focus. Maps await exploration, and we’ll query ways to enhance our creation. Features, tweaks—there’s more to uncover. The journey continues, step by step.
