**Today's Progress**: API and End to End Testing, Team Decisions

**Thoughts:** Last night I went over the workshops from yesterday. I am happy that I did this as I learnt a lot about testing for APIs and for End to end testing. We again went over this, this morning to really cement our knowledge here. End to end testing is about testing the whole process. Front end, back end and DBs. We can do this by coding an automation for our computer to run. Alternatively, we can use tools like playwright. This will allow us to plot user like interactions with our product that can be automated by a computer to test the system is working, in specified ways. Api Testing was about checking we are getting the correct responses when we interact with API's. We can check that we are getting the correct status codes back, as well as other information such as is the data in a Json Statement. I was also introduced to the fist of five method for speeding up team decision making.This was a really good idea. It is something that you would need to agree with the team before the meeting, however this can help speed up decision making in a meeting, or just so the general thoughts of the team towards any point.
