**Today's Progress:** Final Project - Polishing and New Features

**Thoughts:** Today, we rolled up our sleeves for MVP 2. Styling tweaks were on the agenda—buttons aligned, colors adjusted. We wanted the app to feel cozy, like a familiar room.
But that’s not all. We waved goodbye to Bootstrap’s carousel and welcomed a tab system. Clean, straightforward labels guide users. No guessing games. Tomorrow, more pixels, more decisions. But today, we celebrate progress—styling refined, UI elevated.
