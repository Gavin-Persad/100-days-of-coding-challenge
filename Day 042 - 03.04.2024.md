# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 42: 03 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** Product and User Research

**Thoughts:** This week we have taken a step out of coding and into a new area, Product. We have begun the week by thinking about what product is and why an Agile method would produce better results rather than a classic waterfall project. From this we have begun to look into research methods that we can use to understand our problem and how we would attempt to solve this. Today we focussed on the user what the problem is. From this focus we were able to create two personas that faced the problem in different ways. This would eventually lead to a solution that is multi dimensioned and will work for both cases.
