# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 49: 12 April, 2024 

**Today's Progress:** DevOps

**Thoughts:**  The main take from this week have been about CI/CD. Continuous integration and continuous development. In a nutshell this is about always looking for ways to improve the product, making these upgrades and releasing them in small batches as they are ready to keep the product constantly evolving to the users needs. The big head ache of the week was AWS, Docker, Kubrentes and terraform. I am going to have to learn a lot more on these subjects, but for now I don't have a huge need for them. As my projects begin to grow in size and complexity I am sure that I will find a need to make use of these tools available, at which time I will be looking much deeper into them with reasons to be looking which will guide my search a bit better. For now I am happy with a good base knowledge of how they all fit together.
