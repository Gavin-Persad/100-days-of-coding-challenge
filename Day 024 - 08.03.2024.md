**Today's Progress**: Hackathon - Databases

**Thoughts:** I was really happy with the progress on this week's hackathon.
This was due to being able to complete more of the MVPs that we had planned that the previous week.
This was due to realistic planning and more confidence in our abilities to work on request handlers and functions.
Unfortunately, a small oversight upset our presentation. Yet I am very happy with the success we had this week, so today's links are for fun.
