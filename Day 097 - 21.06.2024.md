**Today's Progress:** Getting the balance right

**Thoughts:** Tech interviews can be daunting, especially when they throw vanilla JavaScript problems your way. It’s like revisiting an old friend you haven’t seen in years—familiar yet challenging. But fear not! Here’s my strategy:

Problem Breakdown: When faced with a coding challenge, I take a deep breath and break it down. What’s the problem asking? What are the inputs and expected outputs? Armed with a plan, I tackle it step by step. And yes, Google is my trusty sidekick. There’s no shame in looking up syntax or algorithms—it’s part of the process.

Back to React and Next.js: Ah, the comfort of frameworks! Recently, I resurrected an old game project. In its first iteration, it’s alive and kicking. But now comes the exciting part: deployment. CI/CD pipelines, branching strategies, and testing—these are my next challenges. With React and Next.js by my side, I’ll iterate, improve, and ship this game to the world.

So whether it’s vanilla JS or the fanciest framework, remember: problem-solving is universal. Break it down, Google wisely, and code on!
