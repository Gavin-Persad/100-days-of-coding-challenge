**Today's Progress**: Node JS, Functions and Request Handlers

**Thoughts:** Continuing our work on the back end and APIs, we practised building request handlers and functions to return specified information when requested. This was a great help as even though we touched on this last week, there was plenty of room for a deeper understanding of what was going on. This also led to a further investigation into new methods, such as try and catch and fs.writeFile. I have only learnt about these methods due to tackling a problem, being unsure of how to complete a small section of my broken down algorithm, led me to learn about new methods. This is evidence that the best way to learn is by practising breaking down problems.
