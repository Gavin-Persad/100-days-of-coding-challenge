# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 86+ 87: 03 June, 2024

**Today's Progress:** More side hustle

**Thoughts:** In the past couple of days, my focus has oscillated between two realms: job applications and my side project. The CVs have been meticulously crafted, each word weighed for impact. Yet, if I’m honest, I don’t harbor grand illusions about landing those initial jobs. Instead, I crave feedback—the kind that sharpens my edge, nudges me forward.
Simultaneously, my side project beckons. Figma awaits my styling plans—the blueprint for aesthetics. Once those lines converge, I’ll dive back into code. It’s a dance—between polished resumes and lines of logic. And perhaps, just perhaps, the rhythm will lead me to unexpected doors.
